# CS149

This is my code and writing assignment for studying [CS149](https://gfxcourses.stanford.edu/cs149/fall21/lecture/).

However, for the video, you can watch the CMU 15-418, which is just
like CS149:

+ [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16k4y1z7z9)
+ [Panopto](https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22f62c2297-de88-4e63-aff2-06641fa25e98%22)

However, I find a better [video](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15418-f18/www/schedule.html) which is taught by Randal E. Bryant.
